# School Management Implementation

## Overview
The "Manage Schools" functionality has been implemented in the super-admin dashboard, providing comprehensive school and administrator management capabilities.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Manage Schools Tab**
   - Replaced the "Settings" tab with "Manage Schools" in the super-admin dashboard
   - Displays approved schools with their assigned administrators
   - Shows school details (name, school_id) and admin information

2. **School Approval System**
   - Dropdown selection of available schools from the database
   - Form to assign administrator email, first name, and last name
   - Integration with existing invite system to send registration emails
   - Validation to prevent duplicate assignments

3. **School Listing & Search**
   - Displays all schools with their current admin assignments
   - Search functionality across school names, IDs, and admin details
   - Visual indicators for schools without assigned administrators
   - Real-time filtering and search

4. **Admin Management UI**
   - Lists all administrators for each school
   - Shows admin details (name, email, last login)
   - Remove button for each administrator (frontend ready)

5. **Data Integration**
   - Uses existing `/api/school` endpoint to fetch schools
   - Integrates with `/api/invite` endpoint for sending invitations
   - Maps schools to their assigned administrators from user data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

1. **Admin Removal**
   - Frontend implementation complete
   - API route created (`/api/admin/deactivate`) 
   - **Backend endpoint needed**: The route currently returns 501 (Not Implemented)
   - Would require new backend endpoint: `POST /super_admin/deactivate_admin`

### üîÑ Backend Endpoints Needed

To complete the school management functionality, the following backend endpoints need to be implemented:

#### 1. Deactivate Admin Endpoint
```
POST /super_admin/deactivate_admin
Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
{
  "admin_email": "admin@example.com"
}

Response:
{
  "message": "Admin deactivated successfully",
  "admin_email": "admin@example.com",
  "deactivated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Should set `User.deactivated = True` for the admin
- Should also deactivate all students associated with that admin's school
- Should invalidate any active sessions for the deactivated admin
- Should remove any pending invitations for that email

#### 2. Reactivate Admin Endpoint (Optional)
```
POST /super_admin/reactivate_admin
Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
{
  "admin_email": "admin@example.com"
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced School Endpoint (Optional)
```
GET /super_admin/schools_with_admins
Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>

Response:
{
  "schools": [
    {
      "school_id": "SCH001",
      "name": "Example University",
      "email": "contact@example.edu",
      "admins": [
        {
          "user_id": "ADM123456789",
          "email": "admin@example.edu",
          "first_name": "John",
          "last_name": "Doe",
          "last_login_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
          "deactivated": false
        }
      ],
      "student_count": 150,
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
Kira_frontend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/(dashboard)/super-admin/page.tsx          # Main super-admin dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/api/admin/deactivate/route.ts             # Admin deactivation API route
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SCHOOL_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md           # This documentation
```

### Key Components

1. **ManageSchoolsTab Component**
   - Location: `app/(dashboard)/super-admin/page.tsx`
   - Features: School approval, listing, search, admin management
   - Dependencies: `/api/school`, `/api/invite`, `/api/admin/deactivate`

2. **School Approval Form**
   - Dropdown selection of schools
   - Admin information input (email, first name, last name)
   - Validation and duplicate prevention
   - Integration with invitation system

3. **School List Display**
   - Real-time search and filtering
   - School details with admin assignments
   - Visual indicators for unassigned schools
   - Admin removal functionality

### API Integration

#### Existing APIs Used
- `GET /api/school` - Fetch all schools
- `POST /api/invite` - Send admin invitations

#### New APIs Created
- `POST /api/admin/deactivate` - Deactivate admin accounts (pending backend)

## User Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Only super-admin access | ‚úÖ Complete | Uses existing role-based access control |
| Input school name and admin email | ‚úÖ Complete | Dropdown selection + form inputs |
| School name from dropdown | ‚úÖ Complete | Populated from database |
| Send invite functionality | ‚úÖ Complete | Integrated with existing system |
| Real-time approved list update | ‚úÖ Complete | Updates after successful invite |
| Remove admin functionality | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Frontend ready, backend needed |
| Account deactivation on removal | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending | Requires backend implementation |
| Success/error messages | ‚úÖ Complete | Toast notifications throughout |
| Searchable list view | ‚úÖ Complete | Search by school, admin, email |

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Development Required**
   - Implement `POST /super_admin/deactivate_admin` endpoint
   - Add user deactivation logic to set `User.deactivated = True`
   - Handle cascading deactivation of associated students
   - Add session invalidation for deactivated users

2. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add reactivation functionality
   - Implement audit logging for admin actions
   - Add bulk operations (deactivate multiple admins)
   - Enhanced reporting and analytics

3. **Testing**
   - Test school approval workflow
   - Test search and filtering functionality
   - Test admin removal once backend is implemented
   - Verify access control and permissions

## Security Considerations

- All admin management actions require super-admin authentication
- Email validation prevents invalid admin assignments
- Duplicate prevention ensures data integrity
- Proper error handling prevents information disclosure
- Audit trail should be maintained for all admin actions

## Performance Notes

- School and user data is fetched separately and mapped in frontend
- Search functionality is client-side for responsive UX
- Real-time updates use state management for optimal performance
- API calls are batched where possible to reduce server load
